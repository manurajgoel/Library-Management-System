# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
It is a basically a library management system which has some options like:
1. Display Books"
2. Lend a Book"
3. Add a Book"
4. Return a Book


# Features
- Display all available books in the library
- Lend a book to a user (tracks which user borrowed it)
- Add new books to the collection
- Return borrowed books


It basically helps the library to manage and organise the records of the books present/lended in the library
I have used basic python concepts to make this program like : OOPS, Functions, Data Structures, Loops etc.
